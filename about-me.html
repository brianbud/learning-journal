            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
              After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
              Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert
              code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded
              peers.
            </p>

            <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
            <p>
              I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend
              hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using
              what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
              While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what
              I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
            </p>
            <h2>How I got started I started</h2>
            <p>
              simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take
              notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
              use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
              short summaries of what I learned using my own words. That helped
              me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my
              learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay
              motivated.
